                                    Unity has taken up most of my time while attending Boise State. As mentioned
                                    previously,
                                    I have worked extensively with the Unity Game Engine. Ranging from 2D, 3D, Augmented
                                    Reality,
                                    and Virtual Reality projects. Working with the engine, I have learned a multitude of
                                    different skills
                                    necessary for the industry.

                                    projects I have worked on
                                    while attending Boise State.

                                    A group of friends and I decided to participate in a Christmas game jam. The theme
                                    was obviously Christmas, however there were certain items that needed to be included
                                    in the game such as an anvil. Our game was about delivering presents to a specific
                                    location by solving a riddle.

                                    Gravity Gauntlet is an arcade style racing game. It supports two player split
                                    screen. The idea of Gravity Gauntlet
                                    is to allow players to swap their own gravity. Players can race on a lower and upper
                                    track while dodging obstacle. There is also an AI which acts as a third player.

                                    customizable for people who want to build their own house. This project took place

                                    each designed to make improvments to the game.

                                    In GIMM 250 we were tasked with creating a Comic Strip explaining a very obscure
                                    topic.
                                    The topic
                                    my group was given was Quantum Entanglement. Instead of a comic strip,
                                    we decided to
                                    take a different approach by focusing more on gameplay to
                                    explain the various ideas
                                    related to Quantum Entanglement. A combination of puzzles and voice overs were used
                                    to create this project.

                                    In GIMM 110 we were given an assignment to create an AR mini-game in a group. This
                                    project had multiple phases where we came up with an idea for our game, drafted a
                                    working prototype to highlight gameplay, and lastly a polished version.
                                    Unfortunately, we were unable to add everything to the game that we
                                    wanted, due to time constraints. Therefore, we decided to not include certain
                                    characters. However, we still had a core gameplay loop, which functioned well with
                                    AR.

                                    The first project I created in GIMM 110 was a 2D platformer. I did everything for
                                    this
                                    game
                                    including programming
                                    as well as some artwork. For this game I was tasked with creating a platformer,
                                    shooter,
                                    or a tower defense game. Each
                                    of these had their own base stub which I then had to expand upon. I chose the
                                    platformer
                                    because it is one of the genres of
                                    video games that I enjoyed playing as a kid. We also had to make five changes to the
                                    stub game. These
                                    could be a variety of different changes however, my professor decided to describe
                                    them as "physics changes".
