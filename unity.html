                        <p>
                            Unity has taken up most of my time while attending Boise State. As mentioned previously,
                            I have worked extensively with the Unity Game Engine. Ranging from 2D, 3D, Augmented
                            Reality,
                            and Virtual Reality projects. Working with the engine, I have learned a multitude of
                            different skills
                            necessary for the industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Projects are categorized
                            by group or individual projects. Each project has taught me something different about Unity,
                            whether that be learning C#
                            for the first time or collaborating in a group setting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each project brings something valuable to my skill set and these are some of the best
                            projects I have worked on
                            while attending Boise State.

                                    In GIMM 110 we were given an assignment to create an AR mini-game in a group. This
                                    project had multiple phases where we came up with an idea for our game, drafted a
                                    working prototype to highlight gameplay, and lastly a polished version.
                                    Unfortunately, we were unable to add everything to the game that we
                                    wanted, due to time constraints. Therefore, we decided to not include certain
                                    characters. However, we still had a core gameplay loop, which functioned well with
                                    AR.
                                </P>
                                <P>
                                    My group members and I had planned to add two playable characters along with two
                                    enemies.
                                    The characters that made it into the game were the Knight, which is the player, and
                                    the
                                    Bandit who was our enemy. The other player character was the Mage and the enemy was
                                    a Dragon.

                                    In GIMM 250 we were tasked with creating a Comic Strip explaining a very obscure
                                    topic.
                                    The topic
                                    my group was given was Quantum Entanglement. Instead of a comic strip,
                                    we decided to
                                    take a different approach to this project. We wanted to focus more on gameplay to
                                    explain the various ideas
                                    related to Quantum Entanglement. A combination of puzzles and voice overs were used
                                    to create this project.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was responsible for designing three different puzzles showcasing different
                                    concepts related to Quantum Entanglement.
                                    I also created simple animations to go along with each level. One of the best parts
                                    of
                                    this project was creating
                                    an animation that cuts an apple when you move a knife through it.
                                </p>

                                    Currently in GIMM 375, alongside some friends and myself, are making an open world
                                    spell casting game.
                                    Something like Wizard 101 or New World. This project is still in the early
                                    development
                                    phase however, I believe this will be one of the best projects I am a part of.
                                </P>
                                <p>
                                    We wanted to come up with a magic system that is very different from traditional
                                    spell casting games.
                                    I do not want to speak to heavily on it at this current time as again, we are still
                                    in the early development
                                    stage.
                                </p>

                                    I will say, I am doing much of the programming alongside my friend Jacob
                                    Palin. Programming is my strong
                                    suit and it is what I enjoy the most when it comes to game development. I have

                                    The first project I created in GIMM 110 was a 2D platformer. I did everything for
                                    this
                                    game
                                    including programming
                                    as well as some artwork. For this game I was tasked with creating a platformer,
                                    shooter,
                                    or a tower defense game. Each
                                    of these had their own base stub which I then had to expand upon. I chose the
                                    platformer
                                    because it is one of the genres of
                                    video games that I enjoyed playing as a kid. We also had to make five changes to the
                                    stub game. These
                                    could be a variety of different changes however, my professor decided to describe
                                    them as "physics changes".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I made a total of five physics changes. These changes include double jump when the
                                    player collects 115 coins,
                                    a bouncy effect when the player jumps on specific platforms, falling platforms, a
                                    chasing enemy, and lastly a slow down time
                                    effect.
                                </p>
                                <P>
                                    The game also had some additional features such as teleporting doors, bouncing
                                    enemies, a check point, and a hidden victory flag.
                                    I enjoyed creating this game and it is the main reason I found such a deep passion
                                    for coding and creating video games.

                                    One of the cool aspects about the GIMM program is students get the opportunity to
                                    create their own VR game. This
                                    consists of one to two levels. Students program, design, and model all the
                                    assets for this game. Development
                                    on our individual VR game begins in GIMM 290 which focus on prototyping and coming
                                    up with an idea for our game.

                                    Before I joined the GIMM
                                    program I was in the architect program
                                    at my local community college, College of the Canyons. There I was introduced to how
                                    architects are using VR to showcase a house
                                    to a client. It was interesting to learn about as there are multiple benefits
                                    to using VR in this manner.

                                    In GIMM 350, I came up with the idea to allow the player to customize their house
                                    the way they see fit. They can do this
                                    by placing and swapping out different models. They are then able to go in and walk
                                    around those models. From there they can decide whether
                                    they like the room layout. Players will also be able to populate the space with
                                    furniture and cabinetry. I also created a working
                                    prototype for this game in 350.

                                    Currently in GIMM 360, 370, and 375 I am working on improving this game by adding
                                    audio, more models, textures, and mechanics in order to make a more polished
                                    prototype.
